# Supervised-Learning
## KNN
Our goal towards a  k NN classifier is to build a classifier for face recognition.
Data: We first obtain some data for testing your code. The data resides in the files faces.mat which hold the dataset for further experiments.

## Perceptron
Implementing a simple Perceptron classifier to classify digits (or anything else)
