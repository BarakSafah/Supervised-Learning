# Supervised-Learning
## KNN
Our goal towards a  k NN classifier is to build a classifier for face recognition.
Data: We first obtain some data for testing your code. The data resides in the files faces.mat which hold the dataset for further experiments.

## Perceptron
Implementing a simple Perceptron classifier to classify digits (or anything else)

## Naive Bayes
Create a system that detects every time a word is German and translates it for you in the subtitles.

## Kernel
Implement a linear support vector machine and one operating in kernel space. Formulated the primal and dual optimization problems as quadratic programs using PyTorch

## CART
Implemented a decision tree algorithm and then use it for bagging and boosting
